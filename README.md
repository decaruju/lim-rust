# GOALS
- Orthogonality of features
- No function declaration statement
- No complex scoping, everything is function scoped, no globals
- Small grammar
  - no for/while constructs
  - no if/else 
- First class enum
  - A pattern matching construct
- Few reserved keywords
  - boolean is an enum
- Failing functions are async functions
- No exceptions, every function returns an error monad
- No limitations between language features and user code
  - Operator overloading
  - callable structs
  - natives monkey patching
- Implicit type coercion when obvious
- smallest minimal program
  - no arcane `public static vois main` construct
